**Hello Fellow Coders!**

Welcome to Hand in Hand, a volunteering hub for everyone's volunteering wants and needs. This project targets anyone who is willing to volunteer to help society and the planet as a whole in any aspect, either being location or type of volunteering.

This website aims to aid not only avid volunteers but also newbies who want to start their volunteering journey! The website does this by offering various opportunities both globally or locally (based in the UK). As well as being able to sign-up for up to date information on new opportunities to volunteer.

## Features

We have 4 pages. Landing and opportunities page, become a member page with sign-up form and a completed sign-up page giving the user visual confirmation of sign-up completion.

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**
  - Featured on all 4 pages, includes the website name/logo and the navigation links. Theese are a Home, Opportunities and Become a member link.
  - It's identical on every page and there is an active styling on individual links to show the user which page they are currently on (apart from the completed signup page). This will aid the user with navigation without having to use the back button to navigate forwards and backwards.

- **Footer**

  - Featured on all 4 pages, includes 2 sections, one with contact details and the other with links to social media platforms.
  - The email and phone numbers are accessible directly from the icon if the user has their email/calling set up on their device. The social media links externally go to the respective websites, this is so the user doesnt lose the page they are on, on the website.

#### Landing Page

- **Landing Page Hero Section**

  - The landing page includes a background image relating to the future of the planet, with lower brightness, to give visual aid to the paragraph and CTA button on top.
  - CTA button (Join The Fight) is big and in the center providing visual hierarchy to the user to focus their attention on what I as the developer want them to click on, with an added visual animation of arrows pointing towards the CTA button.

It includes a background image relating to the opportunity plus a small enticing description on what it entails. A visual element added is when hovering over the individual oppportunity, they increase in size to help the user identify which opportunity they are focused on.
  - Each opportunity has a CTA Button. They all link to the Become a Member page for sign-up. Visual aid is also given with changing background and border when hovering over it.
  - Each opportunity also has an associated icon to help the user visually identify which opportuntiy could suit them better.
